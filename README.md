# FIFA Result History

This is a SPA that aims to keep logs of matches played between friends on FIFA, or PES, or whichever is the hip soccer videogame that the cool kids play whenever you are reading this.

The inspiration for this app is the "community" system that older PES games used, where games played locally would have their stats saved to a database so you could see when, and how much you beat your friends, for the sole purpose of bragging rights.
Nowadays, FIFA does not offer a similar system (or maybe they do, but not to the extent I'd like it to be).

The features available right now are:

- Logging of games (Players, Teams and goals scored)
- Standings table (with matches played, won, tied and lost, goals scored, goals against and goal difference)

Planned features are:

- Full fledged profile (Last 5 matches, biggest rivalry, etc.)
- Seasons (for bragging rights, i.e: "I'm the 19-20 champion and you guys can suck it")
- Tournament logs
- Possibly even MORE features!

For now, this is a personal project, meaning I don't mean for the users of this to be anyone other than my own group of friends. 
Also to show off.
