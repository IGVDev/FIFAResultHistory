FIFA Result History

This is a WebApp that aims to keep logs of matches played between friends on FIFA, or PES, or whichever is the hip soccer videogame that kids play whenever you read this.

The inspiration for this app is the "community" system that older PES games used, where games played locally would have their stats saved to a database so you could see when, and how much you beat your friends, for the sole purpose of bragging rights.
Nowadays, FIFA does not offer a similar system (or maybe they do, but not to the extent I'd like it to be).

The features available right now are:

- Logging of games (Players, Teams and goals scored)
- Standings table (with matches played, won, tied and lost, goals scored, goals against and goal difference)

Planned features are:

- Full fledged profile (Last 5 matches, biggest rivalry, etc.)
- Seasons (for bragging rights, i.e: "I'm the 19-20 champion and you guys can suck it")
- Tournament logs
- Possibly even MORE features!

For now, the aim is to be able to use this with my group of friends, but as soon as it reaches V1.0 (which will have features up to Seasons) the plan will be to release it as an actual app, possibly branching out to Android development (sorry iOS users! you'll have to use the webapp).
